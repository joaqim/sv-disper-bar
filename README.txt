== Description ==

The plugin allows WooCommerce users to install a discount progress bar on their website to provide cumulative discounts.
A cumulative discount is a discount that grows with the amount spent: the more you buy, the higher the discount.
The plugin shows clients an attractive indicator at the bottom of the site, thereby informing in advance that when buying a product for a certain amount, the client will receive a discount in accordance with the plugin settings.

### Demonstration of the plugin using a live example

Demonstration works for Storefront & WooCommerce.
